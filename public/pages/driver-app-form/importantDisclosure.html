        Employer, its employees, agents or contractors may obtain one or more reports regarding your driving, and safety inspection history
        from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
        When the application for employment is submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA
        in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide
        you with a copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting
        Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action is taken against you based upon your driving history or safety
        report, the Prospective Employer will notify you that the action has been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole on this
        report.</p>
        <p class = "p-3 mt-5">When the application for employment is submitted by mail, telephone, computer, or other similar means, if the Prospective Employer
        uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding
        you, the Prospective Employer must provide you within three business days of taking adverse action oral, written or electronic
        notification: that adverse action has been taken based in whole or in part on information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and
        the toll free telephone number of FMCSA; that the FMCSA did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide
        you the specific reasons why the adverse action was taken; and that you may, upon providing proper identification, request a free copy
        of the report and may dispute with the FMCSA the accuracy or completeness of any information or report. If you request a copy of a
        driver record from the Prospective Employer who procured the report, then, within 3 business days of receiving your request, together
        with proper identification, the Prospective Employer must send or provide to you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights
        under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

        <p class= "p-3 mt-5"> Neither the Prospective Employer nor the FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety information has the capability to correct
        any safety data that appears to be incorrect. You may challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to
        https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If you challenge crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA cannot change or correct this
        data. Your request will be forwarded by the DataQs system to the appropriate State for adjudication.
        </p>
        
        <p>

        Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will display on your PSP report. Since the PSP report does not report, or assign, or
        imply fault, it will include all Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes
        were reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all inspections, with or without violations, appear on the PSP report. State
        citations associated with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law
        will also appear, and remain, on a PSP report.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prospective Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA without your authorization.
